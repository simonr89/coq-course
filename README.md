# Coq @ Chalmers

Coq course at the Chalmers CSE department, in principle for PhD students.

*Disclaimer:*
- *This course is not guaranteed to take place. Times, contents and evaluation form are provisional and subject to change.*
- *This course is planned as a self-reading course. As such, each person is individually responsible for fulfiling the goals set by the examiner. No assistance is provided beyond what other participants are willing and able to give.*


## Dates

+ The course will take place during 2017 LP3.

## Topics

A list of possible topics to cover. Eventually we will have concrete dates, links to reference material and exercises.

+ Coq fundamentals
+ SSReflect

## Reference material

General reference material for the course.

### Books

(from https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Coq )

+ Benjamin Pierce’s Software Foundations is probably the most elementary introduction to Coq and functional progamming. The book is written in Coq so you can directly open the source files in CoqIDE and step through them to see what is going on and solve the exercises.
  
  http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/
  
  This book should be good for people with a CS background (and some PL on top of that).

+ Adam Chlipala’s Certified Programming with Dependent Types explains more advanced Coq    techniques.

  http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/
  
  It relies heavily on tactics, which can be an impediment if one actually cares about the proof.  
  
+ Mathematical Components (Assia Mahboubi, Enrico Tassi with contributions by Yves Bertot and Georges Gonthier)

  https://math-comp.github.io/mcb/book.pdf
  
  > This books targets two classes of public.  On one hand newcomers, even the
  > more mathematical inclined ones,  find a soft introduction to the programming
  > language of Coq, Gallina, and the *Ssreflect* proof language.  On the other hand
  > accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the formalization style that
  > made the Mathematical Components library possible.

### Exercises 

+ Exercises Written for "Certified Programming with Dependent Types":
  (from http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/ex/ )

  + Snapshot of exercises that were included in CPDT when I decided to stop maintaining exercises (Adam Chlipala)

  + Homeworks from CIS 670 at Penn in Fall 2012 (Benjamin Pierce and students in the class)
    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/670Fall12/
  
+ Exercises from the 2012 International Spring School on FORMALIZATION OF MATHEMATICS

## Examination

Examiner: TBD

Full participation is required. This entails attending the meetings, doing the exercises and presenting some of them. 

## IRC channel

We set up an IRC channel for discussing the course:

    ##coq@chalmers on freenode

Note that there are *two hashes* in the channel name.

## Participants

+ Fabian Ruch
+ Andrea Vezzosi 
+ Víctor López Juan
+ Herbert Lange
+ Daniel Schoepe
+ Simon Robillard
